there's a bunch of mods on the japanese wiki (https://www57.atwiki.jp/cataclyj/pages/235.html), these are the weapons i liked from them. the combat lawnmower, obviously, then the jogiri, fine katana, iron ball and chain and the assassin blade. the translation on these is horrible, and the rest of the mod i didn't really want.. so yeah..

this is just the target dummy from `/gunslingermod`. the recipe is in all the shooting magazines, just use it to place it then it's a mob that can't attack you pretty much, for training up ranged skills.
